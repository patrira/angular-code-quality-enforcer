    <h1>Welcome to Angular Style Showcase</h1>
    <p>
      In this project, we use <strong>ESLint</strong> and
      <strong>Prettier</strong> to ensure our code is clean, consistent, and
      error-free.
    </p>
    <h2>Why ESLint?</h2>
    <p>
      ESLint helps us by statically analyzing our code to find problems and
      suggest fixes. It ensures that our code adheres to best practices and
      avoids common pitfalls.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Prettier?</h2>
    <p>
      Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that helps us maintain a
      consistent style across our codebase. It automatically formats our code
      every time we save, making it easier to read and maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, ESLint and Prettier help us write better code faster, reducing
      the time spent on code reviews and increasing overall productivity.
